# Wordle Python Terminal Game
Wordle was considered the most viral game of 2022. I built the terminal version of the game using Python.

## How it is played ?

1.You have to guess the Wordle in six goes or less

2.Every word you enter must be in the word list. That hasn't been disclosed, but presumably it's based on a dictionary.

3.A correct letter turns green

4.A correct letter in the wrong place turns yellow

5.An incorrect letter turns gray

6.Letters can be used more than once
